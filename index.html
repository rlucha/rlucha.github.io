                    I have joined this startup to develop a multidevice experience for runners to check their results in races, marathons and triathlons. It includes ecommerce features as buying photos or diplomas of the races and will include social features as follow other runners and a personal timeline of results.

                    We're working in a agile environment following the SCRUM methodology with great results.

                    In six months I've delivered the following results:

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Fast prototyping, mockups, html / css layouts using a responsive framework of my own of the entire project.
                    </li>

                <p>
                    I was contracted by Bigbuy to redesign its main ecommerce website and the intranet administrative backend with a strong focus on UX practices. They needed also to create a template system for prestashop to sell customisable microsites to its dropshipping clients.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Their platform was built around Magento and my role was to design a responsive SASS framework with the main priority of being easy to maintain by non CSS experts and very modular to handle future scenarios.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The main milestones achieved were:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Complete overhaul of Magento block-view template system to a proprietary one.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Creation of a BEM, OOCSS based SASS framework with high success for ecommerce sites and backend administrative sites.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Setting up a static page generator workflow to create high fidelity mocks with assemble.io
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    The tools I used in this projects were: axure, SASS, BEM, angularJs, inVision, grunt and assemble.io

                <p>
                    Over this period I went freelance and started working for agencies to create small and medium scale projects such as minigames, landing pages, digital newspaper design, etc.

                    <li>
                        A configurable animation system to feed rich jquery animations to a view in JSON so the designers could add behaviour to a site without coding a single js line made on top of dojo toolkit.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A flash game for a big Spanish company raffle which required the creation of a PHP backend for daily random prize allocation that prevented duplicate prizes and managed additional security.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        An atomic design approach to newspaper layout that I used to coherently design sections across a variety of digital newspaper project and which set the foundation for my own SASS framework.

                <p>
                    Gp-ADS was a media sales company focused on live advertising at golf courses. I was in charge of designing and developing the HTML/CSS part of an "OS desktop like" web experience for their intranet. I created an UI component system to create dynamic forms, wizards and data sheets. I also created many promotional sites using flash and actionScript.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This was a cutting edge project at that time involving:

                <ul>
                    <li> Responsive layouts before @media queries even existed</li>
